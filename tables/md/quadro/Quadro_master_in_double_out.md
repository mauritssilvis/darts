# Quadro 240 board master-in, double-out checkouts

> Checkout tables for master-in, double-out darts games with the Quadro 240 board

## Introduction

This part of the [darts](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts) > [Markdown](../..) project provides checkout tables for darts games with the Quadro 240 board played in master-in, double-out mode.
These tables are valid for games where the first (in) dart must land on a double or a triple, and the last (out) dart must land on a double.

In double-out games with the Quadro 240 board, the last dart can score between 2 and 50 points.
The last two darts can reach 130 points, and 210 points can be scored with the last three.
After a double or triple has been thrown, the extensive [any-in, double-out checkout tables](Quadro_any_in_double_out.md) apply to these scores.

As for master-in, double-out checkouts, the following can be observed.
Darts games commonly require players to score x01 points, where x is an integer.
The following table shows the required number of darts to reach such scores in Quadro 240 board master-in, double-out games.
In addition, the corresponding number of possible checkouts is shown.
