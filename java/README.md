> A Java-based computational toolbox aimed at the game of darts

## Introduction

This part of the [darts](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts) project provides a Java-based computational toolbox aimed at the game of darts.
This command-line toolbox, referred to as `darts` in what follows, can:

- Determine all possible darts checkouts.
- Generate checkout tables for any range of scores.

Additionally, `darts` lets you:

- Choose the dartboard type.
- Select the game mode.
- Set the number of darts.
- Pick the output format.

In what follows, the [installation](#1-installation) and [usage](#2-usage) of `darts` are discussed.
For solutions to commonly occurring problems, refer to the [troubleshooting](#3-troubleshooting) section.
If you are interested in exploring extensive checkout tables for different types of darts games, refer to the [darts > Markdown](../md) readme.
