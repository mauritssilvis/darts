> A Java-based command-line toolbox aimed at the game of darts

## Introduction

This part of the [darts](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts) > [CLI](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts/tree/main/cli) project provides a Java-based command-line toolbox aimed at the game of darts.
This command-line toolbox, referred to as `darts` in what follows, can:

- Determine all possible darts checkouts.
- Generate checkout tables for any range of scores.

Additionally, `darts` lets you:

- Choose the dartboard type.
- Select the game mode.
- Set the number of darts.
- Pick the output format.

The [installation](#1-installation) and [usage](#2-usage) of `darts` are discussed, in what follows.
For solutions to commonly occurring problems, refer to the [troubleshooting](#3-troubleshooting) section.
If you would like to explore extensive checkout tables for different types of darts games, refer to the [Markdown checkout tables](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts/tree/main/tables/md).

## 1. Installation

To use `darts`, you have to execute the following steps.

### 1.1 Install Java 17+

`darts` requires the installation of Java 17 or higher.

You can install the latest version of Java as follows:

- Go to https://jdk.java.net/.
- Navigate to the page with the latest ready-to-use version of the Java Development Kit (JDK), currently JDK 19.
- From the builds section, download the archive matching your system.
- Extract the archive to a convenient location.
- Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the full path of the extracted `jdk-XX.X.X` folder.

### 1.2 Build `darts`

You can build the `darts` toolbox as follows:

- Clone or download the `darts` code from https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts.
- If necessary, extract the code to a convenient location.
- Navigate to the `java` folder that is part of the code.
- Run the `install` command.
- Test execution of the `darts` toolbox by running the `darts` command.

#### 1.2.1 Command execution

On Unix-like systems, the `install` and `darts` commands can be executed as follows:

- Open a terminal.
- Navigate to the `java` folder that is part of the `darts` code.
- Run the `install` command by executing `./install`.
- Run the `darts` command by executing `./darts`.

On Windows, the `install` and `darts` commands can be executed using the command prompt or the PowerShell.

With the command prompt, the execution of commands works as follows:

- Open the command prompt, for example, by pushing the `Windows key`, typing `cmd` and hitting `Enter`.
- Navigate to the `java` folder that is part of the `darts` code.
- Run the `install` command by executing `install`.
- Run the `darts` command by executing `darts`.

With the PowerShell, execution works as follows:

- Open the PowerShell, for example, by pushing the `Windows key`, typing `powershell` and hitting `Enter`.
- Navigate to the `java` folder that is part of the `darts` code.
- Run the `install` command by executing `.\install`.
- Run the `darts` command by executing `.\darts`.

#### 1.2.2 Troubleshooting

Should any problems occur while building `darts`, please refer to the [troubleshooting](#3-troubleshooting) section.

## 3. Troubleshooting

### 3.1 Installation

#### 3.1.1 The `install` command was not found

While trying to build `darts`, you may encounter the following errors:

```text
install: command not found
```

```text
'install' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program
or batch file.
```

```text
install : The term 'install' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet,
function, script file, or operable program.
```

```text
install: missing file operand
Try 'install --help' for more information.
```

To solve these problems, take the following steps:

- Ensure you navigated to the `java` folder that is part of the `darts` code.
- Prefix the `install` command with `./` (Bash) or `.\` (PowerShell) before execution.

#### 3.1.2 Java was not installed or found

While building or executing `darts`, you may encounter the following errors:

```text
JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.
```

```text
JAVA_HOME is set to an invalid directory: ...
```

To solve these problems, follow the instructions for [installing Java 17+](#11-install-java-17).

#### 3.1.3 The `darts` toolbox was not built

While executing `darts`, you may encounter the following error:

```text
Error: Could not find or load main class nl.mauritssilvis.darts.java.cli.DartsApp
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: nl.mauritssilvis.darts.java.cli.DartsApp
```

To solve this problem, [build](#12-build-darts) the `darts` toolbox.

#### 3.1.4 Java is not up-to-date

While executing `darts`, you may encounter the following error:

```text
