> Darts checkout tables in the Markdown format

## Overview

This part of the [Darts](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts) project provides extensive checkout tables for different dartboards and game modes.
The checkout tables apply to the 'standard' London dartboard or the Quadro board, and are valid for different combinations of requirements on the first (in) and last (out) darts.
