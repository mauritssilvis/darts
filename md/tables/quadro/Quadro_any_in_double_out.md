## Introduction

This part of the [darts](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts) > [Markdown](../..) project provides checkout tables for darts games with the Quadro 240 board played in any-in, double-out mode.

Darts games commonly require players to score x01 points, where x is an integer.
The following table shows the required number of darts to reach such scores in Quadro 240 board any-in, double-out games.
In addition, the corresponding number of possible checkouts is shown.

|------------:|------:|------------:|
| [101](#101) |     2 |           1 |
|         201 |     4 |       3,244 |
