# Java darts core

> A Java implementation of the `darts` toolbox

## Introduction

This part of the [darts](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts) > [Core](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts/tree/main/core) project provides a Java implementation of `darts`, a computational toolbox aimed at the game of darts.
This implementation can:

- Determine all possible darts checkouts.
- Generate checkout tables for any range of scores.

Additionally, this implementation lets you:

- Choose the dartboard type.
- Select the game mode.
- Set the number of darts.
- Pick the output format.

To explore the Java implementation of `darts`, dive into the [code](src).
Alternatively, you can download the Java darts core code from the latest Java darts release at https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts/releases.
The release history of the Java darts core project is contained in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

If you would like to generate checkout tables using a command-line application, refer to the [Java-based command-line interface](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts/tree/main/cli/java-darts-cli).
If you want to explore extensive checkout tables for different types of darts games, refer to the [checkout table overview](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/darts/tree/main/tables/md-darts-tables).
