> A computational toolbox aimed at the game of darts

## Introduction

In darts, there is always something to compute.
How many points did I score?
How many are left?
What is my average score?
What percentage of my darts successfully hit a double?

This project focuses on the following questions:

* How can I reach zero in a game of darts?
* How many of these so-called checkouts are there?

To answer these questions, this project presents a computational toolbox going by the name of `darts`.

## Toolbox

`darts` can determine all possible checkouts and generate checkout tables for any range of scores.
This toolbox supports several dartboards, including the ‘standard’ London dartboard and the Quadro 240 board.
In addition, several game modes are supported, including modes that require players to start or end with double or triple fields.
Finally, `darts` can provide output in several formats: easily readable Markdown tables, HTML tables for web pages and JSON objects for computer processing.

Currently, `darts` is available as a Java-based command-line application.
More information about the installation and use of this app can be found on the [darts > Java](java) page.
If you are interested in checking out those checkout tables, refer to the [darts > Markdown](md) page.
Read on to learn more about the observations that can be made using `darts`.
