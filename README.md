# Darts

> A computational toolbox aimed at the game of darts

## Introduction

In darts, there is always something to compute:

* How many points did I score? How many are left?
* What is my average score? What percentage of my darts successfully hit a double?

This project focuses on the following questions:

* How can I reach zero in a game of darts?
* How many of these so-called *checkouts* are there?
